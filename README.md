# DynamoDB_NoSQLProject

Developed a web application for loan approval using AWS services, integrating a React frontend with AWS Amplify for CI/CD and hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless backend processing, and Amazon DynamoDB for storing user data securely.

Designed and implemented a responsive user interface allowing customers to input their details, including credit score and income, to determine loan eligibility based on configurable thresholds set by the admin.

Implemented secure and scalable API interactions using AWS API Gateway and AWS IAM, ensuring that only authorized AWS Lambda functions could access and manipulate data in DynamoDB, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the application.
